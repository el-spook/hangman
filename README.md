## Installation

Go to the green "Code" button and select "download Zip".

Once you've unzipped the folder, move it to a convenient location on your local machine.

Open your terminal and navigate to the game folder (the one containing the package.json).

Run `npm install`. This will replace the node packages that are needed for the game to run.

Once the folders are downloaded, run `npm start`
