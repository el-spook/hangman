## Installation

Go to the green "Code" button and select "download Zip". Alternatively, use the git clone method which is also available via the green "Code" button.

Once you've unzipped the folder, move it to a convenient location on your local machine.

Open your terminal and navigate to the game folder (the one containing the package.json file).

Run `npm install`. This will replace the node packages that are needed for the game to run.

Once the folders are downloaded, run `npm start`. 

The app will now open in a new browser window, or you can navigate to it at [localhost:3000/](localhost:3000/).


## How to Play

The aim of the game is to guess the randomly generated word before the final image is displayed.

* To start, click the green "New Game" button.
* You can hide the instructions by pressing the "Hide Help" button. 
* Click the "Help" button at any point to read the instructions again.
